# Tree

BinaryTree():

.pre_order() - BinaryTree method to return an array of trre values in "pre-order" order
.in_order() - BinaryTree method to return an array of tree values "in-order"
.post_order() - BinaryTree method to return an array of tree values "post-order
BinarySearchTree(BinaryTree):

.add(value) - BinarySearchTree method that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree
.contains(value) - BinarySearchTree method that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

### Cases : 

* Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
* Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
* Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
* Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
* Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
* Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
