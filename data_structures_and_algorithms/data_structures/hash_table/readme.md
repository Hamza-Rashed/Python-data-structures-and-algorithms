# Hash table 

# Challenge : 
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

# Efficiency
* Time Complexity: O(1)
* Space Complexity: O(n)
