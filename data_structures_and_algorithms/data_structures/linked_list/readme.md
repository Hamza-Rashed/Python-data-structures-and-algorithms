# Linked List

## We used many functions :: 
* LinkedList() for create new linked list
* name.insert(data) insert the head after that it will continue the linked list...
* name.include(data) searching inside the linked list for your data and return boolian..
* name.__str__() retruning the linked list nodes by specifec format '{ a } -> { b } -> NULL'
* delete_value for deleteing the 

## and create some rouls  :  
 Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
 Where k and the length of the list are the same
 Where k is not a positive integer
 Where the linked list is of a size 1
 “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list

By function called kthFromEnd
