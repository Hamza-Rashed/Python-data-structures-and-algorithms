# Multi Bracket Validation

### Create function called multi_bracket_validation() 
This function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

   * Round Brackets : ()
   * Square Brackets : []
   * Curly Brackets : {}
